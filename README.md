# scRNAseq B cell in pSS

This is a repository associated to the publication "Multi-modal single cell
sequencing of B cells in primary Sjögren’s Syndrome" (link to bioRxiv)

Here you can find all analysis steps from raw data to the figures in the manuscript.
Briefly, all analysis scripts herein were run inside `conda` environments {REF},
to enforce software reproducibility. Here, we provide two conda environment files.
The file `environment_pSS.yml` contains 
- `environment_pSS_MacOS.yml`
